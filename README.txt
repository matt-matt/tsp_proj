To run my code, change the corresponding parameters for W, H, and N in main.cpp,
and then compile it with

$make

and run it with

$./TSP

Print commands are commented out in makeTSP2 and makeTSP_1.5. If you wish to see
a verbose run of the program, un-comment lines 113 and 314 in MST.cpp, compile
and run.
